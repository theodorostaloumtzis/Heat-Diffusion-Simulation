### Implementation Explanation

This code implements a heat diffusion simulation in a two-dimensional grid using the finite difference method. Let’s go step by step to see what each part of the code does.

#### Constants and Setup

```c
#define GRID_SIZE 100
#define TIMESTEPS 100000
#define DT 0.1
#define DX 1.0
#define ALPHA 0.01
```

These macros define the constants for the simulation:
- `GRID_SIZE`: the size of the grid, 100x100 cells.
- `TIMESTEPS`: the number of time steps in the simulation.
- `DT`: the time step.
- `DX`: the spatial step.
- `ALPHA`: the thermal diffusivity of the material.

#### Grid Initialization

```c
void initialize(double grid[GRID_SIZE][GRID_SIZE]) {
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < GRID_SIZE; j++) {
            if (i >= GRID_SIZE / 2 - 24 && i < GRID_SIZE / 2 + 24 && 
                j >= GRID_SIZE / 2 - 24 && j < GRID_SIZE / 2 + 24) {
                grid[i][j] = 100.0;
            } else {
                grid[i][j] = 0.0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `initialize` function fills the grid with initial temperature values:
- For the cells in the center of the grid, i.e., in the 48x48 square centered around (50, 50), the temperature is set to 100 degrees.
- All other cells are initialized to 0 degrees.

#### Updating the Grid

```c
void update(double grid[GRID_SIZE][GRID_SIZE]) {
    double temp[GRID_SIZE][GRID_SIZE];
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < GRID_SIZE; j++) {
            if (i == 0 || i == GRID_SIZE - 1 || j == 0 || j == GRID_SIZE - 1) {
                temp[i][j] = grid[i][j];
            } else {
                temp[i][j] = grid[i][j] +
                             ALPHA * DT / (DX * DX) *
                             (grid[i+1][j] + grid[i-1][j] +
                              grid[i][j+1] + grid[i][j-1] -
                              4 * grid[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    for (i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < GRID_SIZE; j++) {
            grid[i][j] = temp[i][j];
        }
    }
}
```

The `update` function updates the grid at each time step:
- It uses a temporary array `temp` to store new temperature values.
- For cells on the boundary of the grid, the values remain the same (Dirichlet boundary conditions).
- For the other cells, it applies the heat diffusion equation using a finite difference approach. The new temperature calculation is based on the temperatures of neighboring cells.
- After the calculation, the values from the `temp` array are copied back into the original `grid` array.

#### Writing to a File

```c
void writeToFile(double grid[GRID_SIZE][GRID_SIZE], char* filename) {
    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "w");
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < GRID_SIZE; j++) {
            fprintf(file, "%f ", grid[i][j]);
        }
        fprintf(file, "\n");
    }
    fclose(file);
}
```

The `writeToFile` function writes the grid to a text file:
- It opens the file for writing.
- It prints the temperature of each cell in a grid format. Each line of the file corresponds to one row of the grid.
- It closes the file.

#### Main Function

```c
int main() {
    double grid[GRID_SIZE][GRID_SIZE];
    clock_t start, end;

    start = clock();
    initialize(grid);
    int t;
    for (t = 0; t < TIMESTEPS; t++) {
        update(grid);
    }
    end = clock();
    printf("Time taken: %fs\n", (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC);
    writeToFile(grid, "heatmap_serial.txt");

    return 0;
}
```

The `main` function runs the simulation:
- It creates the `grid` array for the temperature grid.
- Records the start time.
- Initializes the grid.
- Executes the time steps by repeatedly calling the `update` function.
- Records the end time and calculates the total execution time.
- Writes the final results to a file.
- Returns 0, indicating successful program execution.
